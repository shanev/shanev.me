    <p>
    I'm a software engineer / entrepreneur on a mission to build products and services that are more decentralized and equitable.
    </p>
    <p>
    Most recently, I led the engineering team at {{< external href="https://beta.trustory.io/" text="TruStory" />}}, a social app built on a proof-of-stake blockchain with {{< external href="https://cosmos.network/" text="Cosmos SDK" />}}.
    </p>
    <p>
    Previously I built the iOS app for {{< external href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/ted/id376183339" text="TED" />}}. I also independently built {{< external href="https://www.drumkit.co/" text="Drum Kit" />}}, a top selling music app with 10 million downloads. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I was an early contributer to many projects in the Ruby ecosystem, including Rails.

I got my start in technology in the early 90's as an operator of a [BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system), an early form of pre-Internet social network. I taught myself to code so I could make plugins for the BBS.

I focused more on the hardware side in college, once designing a 16-bit microprocessor for a class project. I graduated with an M.S in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Electromagnetics. 

After college, I moved back into software and worked at Motorola, building government encryption software. Later I joined Orbitz, where I helped scale backends for airline reservation systems. 

In the early 2000's I got involved in the early development of Ruby on Rails, building open source libraries that were used by startups such as Github, Shopify, and Twitter. I launched my [first startup](http://shanesbrain.net/2007/09/01/myfitbuddy-com-launched.html) in 2007, a social network for fitness ethusiasts. It was one of the first sites to feature a live newsfeed.

In early 2008 I quit my job at Groupon after [Ken Pelletier](https://www.chicagomediaproject.org/ken-pelletier), then CTO, showed me a demo of Google Maps on his iPhone. I went on to release [Drum Kit](http://www.drumkit.co), one of the most popular apps in the App Store built by an indie developer. It had over 10 million downloads, and was featured in Apple's iPod Touch ad campaign. 

Later in 2008, I [built and open sourced](https://github.com/shanev/friendfeed-iphone) a fully native iOS app for (now defunct) [FriendFeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendFeed). This caught the attention of Facebook, who attempted to recruit me for their native mobile team. Around this time I also rejected offers to be one of the first hires (if not the first) at Airbnb, Square, and Calm.

Around 2015, I started getting disillusioned by the tech industry and considered studying to become a nutritionist. However I decided to apply my skills to non-profits instead. I joined TED, where I re-wrote their iOS app in Swift.

In early 2017, [Marie Leaf](https://twitter.com/mariesleaf) introduced me to Ethereum. The ecosystem reminded me a lot my early BBS days. It rekindled my interest in tech, and I went deep into the rabbit-hole, learning about distributed systems and blockchains.
