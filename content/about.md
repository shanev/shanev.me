    <p>
    Hello! I'm currently building {{< external href="http://www.stargaze.fi" text="Stargaze" />}}, a decentralized, user-owned and operated crypto network.
    </p>
    <p>
    Previously, I led the engineering team at a crypto startup, where we built
    one of the first {{< external href="https://blog.cosmos.network/building-a-decentralized-app-with-cosmos-sdk-3c535cdc6a6a" text=" decentralized social apps" />}} on a sovereign {{< external href="https://cosmos.network" text=" Cosmos" />}} blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>
    In another life, I built {{< external href="https://www.drumkit.co/" text="Drum Kit" />}}, one of the top 10 music apps in the App Store for nearly 5 years. It got over 10M downloads, and was featured on {{< external href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/michael_speedracer/4311175819/" text="Apple billboards " />}} and TV ads.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can find me on {{< external href="https://twitter.com/shanev" text="Twitter" />}}, and my code on {{< external href="https://github.com/shanev" text="Github" />}}.

## BBS / hacker era

I got my start in technology in the early 90's running Broon's Bane {{< external href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" text="BBS" />}}, a software piracy network that predated BitTorrent. I taught myself to code in {{< external href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCBoard" text="PPL" />}} (now defunct) to make a leaderboard for seeder/leecher (upload/download) ratios. My BBS career ended when a German telecom sent a cease and desist letter to my parents, causing them to confiscate my computers and modems. I had hacked into their {{< external href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_telephone_system" text="PBX" />}}, allowing me to make free long-distance calls to other BBSes. The only remains I can find of Broon's Bane is this fan created {{< external href="https://demozoo.org/productions/184400/" text="ASCII" />}} {{< external href="https://defacto2.net/f/ae2a996" text="art" />}}.

## School

Since I already did a lot of programming in my spare time, I wanted to focus more on theory and hardware in college. I got a dual degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering from Rutgers University, and an M.S in Electrical Engineering from Illinois Institute of Technology. I designed a 16-bit microprocessor for a class project, and wrote a paper on {{< external href="https://www.scribd.com/document/365777936/Quantum-Computing-with-Quantum-Dots" text="Quantum Computing" />}} for my graduate thesis.

## Enterprise era (skip)

After college, I moved back into software and worked at Motorola, building government encryption software. Later I joined Orbitz, where I helped scale backends for airline reservation systems. I learned a lot about building software at scale, but longed for working with small fast-paced teams with less bureaucracy.

## Web 2.0 / Facebook apps era

In the early 2000's I got involved in the development of Ruby on Rails. I added {{< external href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/7370642" text="timestamps" />}} to Rails, a feature that is now common in most web frameworks. I also released {{< external href="https://github.com/shanev?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=ruby" text="a lot of open source libraries" />}}, and contributed to Typo, a now defunct blogging platform started by Tobi LÃ¼tke before he left to start Shopify. I also launched {{< external href="http://shanesbrain.net/2007/09/01/myfitbuddy-com-launched.html" text="a social network for fitness enthusiasts" />}} in 2007. It was one of the first sites to feature a live newsfeed.

Another contribution was {{< external href="https://github.com/mmangino/facebooker" text="Facebooker" />}}, the default library for making Facebook apps with Rails at that time. I used it to build a Facebook app that had ~3 million users at its peak. I also authored a book on {{< external href="https://www.slideshare.net/sushilprajapati/peepcode-facebook2rails-on-facebook" text="Facebook app development" />}}.

## iOS era

In early 2008, {{< external href="https://www.chicagomediaproject.org/ken-pelletier" text="Groupon's CTO" />}} showed me a demo of Google Maps on his iPhone. At that moment I knew mobile was <strong><i>the futureâ„¢</i></strong>. I quit my job the next day and went on to build {{< external href="http://www.drumkit.co" text="Drum Kit" />}}. It ended up getting 10M+ downloads, and was featured in Apple's iPod Touch ad campaign. It remained one of the top 10 music apps for nearly 5 years.

Around 2013, I started getting disillusioned with the tech industry due to the increased centralization of power, and considered studying to become a nutritionist. However I decided to apply my skills to non-profits, and joined {{< external href="https://www.ted.com/" text="TED" />}} where I built new versions of their iPhone and iPad apps. I also heard about Bitcoin around this time but didn't think too much of it.

## Crypto / DeFi era

In 2016, {{< external href="https://twitter.com/mariesleaf" text="a friend" />}} introduced me to Ethereum and crypto in general. The hacker ethos of the ecosystem reminded me a lot of the BBS-era and early days of the Internet. As I explored the space, I saw the potential it has to re-decentralize the Internet, and build new services on a foundation of sound money. I'm especially excited about crypto's potential for user owned and operated digital communities.
