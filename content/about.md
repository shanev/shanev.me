    I'm a software engineer / founder on a mission to use software for social and environmental impact.
    </p>
    <p>
    Recently, I led the engineering team at {{< external href="https://beta.trustory.io/" text="TruStory" />}}, building a {{< external href="https://blog.cosmos.network/building-a-decentralized-app-with-cosmos-sdk-3c535cdc6a6a" text="decentralized app" />}} that attempted to address misinformation in media through incentivized debate.
    </p>
    <p>
    Previously, I helped build TED for iOS. It was one of the top rated apps in education, and was featured in Apple keynotes. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I also built {{< external href="https://www.drumkit.co/" text="Drum Kit" />}}, one of the top 10 music apps in the App Store for nearly 5 years. It got over 10M downloads, and was featured on {{< external href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/michael_speedracer/4311175819/" text="Apple billboards " />}} and TV ads.

## Pre-history

I got my start in technology in the early 90's as an operator of a {{< external href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" text="BBS" />}}, an early form of pre-Internet social network built around trading software and games. I taught myself to code to make plugins for it. My BBS career ended when a German telecom sent a cease and desist letter, causing my parents to confiscate my computers. I had hacked into their {{< external href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_telephone_system" text="systems" />}} to make free phone calls. 

I focused more on the hardware side in college, once designing a 16-bit microprocessor for a class project. I graduated with an M.S in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Electromagnetics. 

After college, I moved back into software and worked at Motorola, building government encryption software. Later I joined Orbitz, where I helped scale backends for airline reservation systems. 

In the early 2000's I got involved in the development of Ruby on Rails, building open source libraries that were used by many web 2.0 startups of the time. I launched {{< external href="http://shanesbrain.net/2007/09/01/myfitbuddy-com-launched.html" text="a social network for fitness enthusiasts" />}} in 2007. It was one of the first sites to feature a live newsfeed.

In early 2008 I quit my job at Groupon after {{< external href="https://www.chicagomediaproject.org/ken-pelletier" text="Ken Pelletier" />}}, then CTO, showed me a demo of Google Maps on his iPhone. I went on to release {{< external href="http://www.drumkit.co" text="Drum Kit" />}}, one of the most popular apps in the App Store built by an indie developer. It had over 10 million downloads, and was featured in Apple's iPod Touch ad campaign. 

Around 2013, I started getting disillusioned by the tech industry and considered studying to become a nutritionist. However I decided to apply my skills to non-profits instead. I joined {{< external href="https://www.ted.com/" text="TED" />}}, building new versions of their iPhone and iPad apps. I also heard about Bitcoin around this time but didn't think too much of it.

In 2016, {{< external href="https://twitter.com/mariesleaf" text="a friend" />}} introduced me to Ethereum and crypto in general. The hacker ethos of the ecosystem reminded me a lot of the BBS-era and early days of the Internet. As I explored the space, I saw the potential it has to re-decentralize the Internet, and build new services on a foundation of sound money.
